Description
===

Simply put... *WordPress* is one of the best content managements systems available today. Digital signage management is a content management problem. As for *futusign* itself, hearing how others are using it is the best way to understand the possibilities.

The [Digital Signage Case Study: Warrington College of Business]( https://www.futusign.com/stories/digital-signage-case-study-warrington/) illustrates a medium-sized futusign deployment at an educational institution.

Installation
====

Install and activate the *futusign* plugin via the WordPress *Plugins* admin
screen.

Usage
====
Using your favorite presentation tool, e.g., *PowerPoint*, create a slide show with the same resolution and aspect ratio of the target display screen; for example 1920px by 1080px for an landscape HD screen. Save it as a series of images.

From the *WordPress* administrative screens.

1. Add a new *Image* (or multiple) from the admin menu; uploading the
image file.
2. Update the *Image Duration* as desired.
3. While adding the image, also add it to a new *Playlist*.
4. Add a new *Screen* from the admin menu.
5. Update the *Polling Cycle* as desired.
6. While adding the screen, also subscribe it to the created *Playlist*.
7. View the *Screen*.

When editing a screen; a list of the currently playing media is provided.

To create a digital sign, connect a television to a computer with Chrome browser and have it load the *Screen's* URL. The loaded web application will check every hour (configurable) to automatically apply changes made on the admin screens.
